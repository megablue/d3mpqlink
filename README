This script allows you to Use USB Flash + RAM drive to host your D3 files! Running D3 from a USB Flash drive give you much smoother gameplay. The script also help you to host Sound.mpq with a RAMdisk (you must setup the RAMdisk first) . Advantage of my script over convention method is you can use a cluster of smaller USB drive to host the files instead of requiring a 16GB USB Flash drive (although you still can use that if you want).

Requirement:
1. In order to host the MPQ files on USB drive, you must have at least 
- 16GB USB drive x1
OR
- 8GB USB drive x1 
- 4GB USB drive x1
OR
- 4GB USB drive x3

2. (OPTIONAL but highly recommended!! ) In order to host Sound.mpq on a RAMDISK you must first setup Radeon RAMDISK ( 4GB free version) on your PC. Just make sure you have 6GB or more RAM on your PC. You need to setup a 1,300MB RAMdisk. Remember to save the disk image after running the script & Load Disk Image at Startup so that Sound.mpq can persists over PC reboots.
